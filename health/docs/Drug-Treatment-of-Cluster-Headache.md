Abstract  
Cluster headache belongs to the group of trigeminal autonomic headaches. This review summarizes drug therapy of cluster   
attacks and prophylactic treatment. Neurostimulation methods are not addressed. The therapy for acute cluster attacks includes   
inhalation of 100% oxygen, subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan, and intranasal application of sumatriptan or zolmitriptan.   
Bridging therapy, which is used until oral prophylactic therapy is effective, is performed either with oral prednisolone or with   
a pharmacological block of the major occipital nerves. Best documented drugs for preventive treatment of cluster headache are   
verapamil and lithium, and possibly effective drugs are gabapentin, topiramate, divalproex sodium, and melatonin. The efficacy   
of monoclonal antibodies to the calcitonin gene-related peptide so far has been only demonstrated for episodic cluster headache.   
Several drug therapies are  being investigated including ketamine, onabotulinumtoxinA, lysergic acid, and sodium oxybate.  
  
Key Points   
  
1  Introduction  
  
Cluster headache is a rare trigeminal autonomic head-  
ache associated with severe attacks of hemifacial pain.   
Episodic cluster headache (90%) is distinguished from   
chronic cluster headache (10%).  
  
Therapy of single cluster attacks is by inhalation of   
100% oxygen using a rebreather mask, subcutaneous   
administration of sumatriptan, or intranasal application   
of sumatriptan or zolmitriptan.  
  
Oral prophylaxis for cluster headache must be increased   
slowly, to reduce adverse events. Until this medication is   
effective, bridging therapy with oral prednisolone or an   
occipital nerve blockade may be useful.  
  
For prophylaxis of cluster headache, the best scientific   
evidence is for verapamil and lithium. Based on the   
results of open trials, topiramate, gabapentin, valproic   
acid, and melatonin, and for episodic cluster headache,   
galcanezumab may be effective.

Cluster headache belongs to the group of trigeminal auto-  
nomic headaches according to the criteria of the Inter-  
national Headache Society [1]. In addition to the strictly   
hemicranial  headache  occurring  in  attacks,  the  pain  is   
associated with cranial autonomic symptoms on the side   
of the pain.  
  
Cluster headache is characterized by strictly unilateral   
attacks of severe head and facial pain. Cluster headache is   
a primary headache, i.e., the headache is a syndrome in its   
own right and not just a symptom of another disease. The   
attacks reach their maximum within a short time and may   
also have a rapid offset. The pain is extremely severe. The   
localization is strictly unilateral with a particular locali-  
zation orbital, retro-orbital, and frontotemporal. Cranial   
autonomic symptoms ipsilateral to the pain occur during   
the attack. These include conjunctival injection and/or   
lacrimation, nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid   
edema, forehead and facial sweating, forehead and facial   
skin redness, ptosis, and or miosis. Attacks are accom-  
panied by physical agitation or restlessness. Attacks last   
between 15 min and 3 h and can be triggered by the intake   
of alcohol if the patient is in the active period. Attack fre-  
quency ranges from one attack every 2 days to eight attacks   
per day. For episodic cluster headache, bouts frequently   
start with one to two attacks per week, may progress to   
several/day over 1–2 weeks, and then taper over 1–2 weeks   
after occurring at the high plateau for up to several or more

weeks. There is a circadian rhythm with attacks occurring   
at the same time of the night or day. Cluster attacks are   
also more frequent in spring and autumn. It is clinically   
important to highlight that even patients with long-lasting   
chronic cluster headache show a cycling pattern and that   
an increase in attack frequency does not necessarily mean   
that medication is failing but rather that for some time   
add-on therapy may be necessary. Cluster attacks seem to   
get less severe once the patient gets older and may disap-  
pear altogether in most patients. The male:female ratio of   
occurrence may range from 2:1 to 6:1 [2].  
  
A distinction is made between episodic and chronic clus-  
ter headache. Episodic cluster headache occurs in 90% of   
patients, with episodes lasting 1–2 months, followed by   
months to years of remission [1]. In chronic cluster head-  
ache, remissions no longer occur, or if they do, they last   
shorter than 12 weeks at a stretch. In some patients, there   
is a transition from episodic to chronic cluster headache;   
in a sub-group, the cluster headache is primarily chronic.   
In this review, we summarize the most important data on   
the treatment of cluster attacks and the prevention of clus-  
ter headache with recommendations for the management of   
these patients. Therapy of cluster headache consists of the   
medical abortion of the single attack, bridging therapy to   
cover the time until the prophylactic treatment takes effect,   
and the actual preventive therapy. In the field of preventive   
treatment of cluster headache, there are unfortunately very   
few placebo-controlled studies. Therefore, most treatment   
recommendations are limited to results from open observa-  
tional studies.  
  
2   Treatment of Cluster Attacks  
  
The individual cluster attacks are rather short and between   
15 and 180 min. Therefore, oral medication is not recom-  
mended. The cluster attacks are treated with subcutaneous   
  
sumatriptan or triptans as nasal sprays. An effective therapy   
is oxygen inhalation using a rebreather mask. The efficacy   
of this therapy has been demonstrated in placebo-controlled   
studies [3, 4] (Table 1).  
  
2.1   Subcutaneous Sumatriptan  
  
By far the most effective therapy for acute cluster attacks is   
the subcutaneous injection of 6 mg of sumatriptan. In the   
first randomized placebo-controlled trial with 39 patients,   
two cluster attacks were treated in random order with 6   
mg  of  sumatriptan  subcutaneously  or  placebo.  The  pri-  
mary endpoint was freedom from pain or almost complete   
relief from headache within 10 or 15 min [5]. This endpoint   
[15 min] was achieved in 74% of the patients treated with   
sumatriptan and 26% for placebo. The success rate of 6 mg   
of sumatriptan subcutaneously for pain free at 10 min was   
36% and for placebo 3% [5]. The second study investigated   
6 and 12 mg of sumatriptan subcutaneously compared to   
placebo. Headache improvement to mild or no pain at 15   
min was 35% for placebo, 75% for 6 mg of sumatriptan, and   
80% for 12 mg of sumatriptan [6]. The pooled analysis of   
the Cochrane Collaboration reported pain-free results after   
15 min for 48% with sumatriptan and 17% with placebo,   
resulting in a number needed to treat of 3.3 (95% confidence   
interval [CI] 2.4–5.0). The rates for headache relief after 15   
min were 32% and 7%, resulting in a number needed to treat   
of 2.4 (95% CI 1.9–3.2) [7].  
  
Meanwhile, a 3-mg dose of sumatriptan subcutaneously   
is also available in some countries and sufficient for some   
patients [8]. Sumatriptan is well tolerated. Rare adverse   
events (AEs) include local injection-site reactions, nausea,   
drowsiness,  fatigue,  and  paresthesia.  Contraindications,   
according to the label, include severe cardiovascular dis-  
eases such as coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke and   
transient ischemic attack, or multiple vascular risk factors.   
Although many patients with cluster headache have vascu-  
lar risk factors [9], there have been no reports of stroke or   
  
35  
  
myocardial infarction in patients with cluster headache treat-  
ing their attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan. It must be   
considered that some patients with chronic cluster headache   
inject sumatriptan three times daily or more for years.  
  
2.2   Sumatriptan Nasal Spray  
  
indirect comparisons, the efficacy is inferior to that of the   
subcutaneous application of sumatriptan. Patients with epi-  
sodic cluster headache respond usually better than patients   
with chronic cluster headache. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is   
only available in a 5-mg dose.  
  
Sumatriptan  nasal  spray  was  investigated  in  a  dose  of   
20 mg in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled   
trial [10]. The study included patients with episodic and   
chronic cluster headache. Patients treated one attack with   
a sumatriptan 20-mg nasal spray and another attack with   
placebo. Headache intensity was measured on a five-point   
scale at time intervals between 5 and 30 min. The primary   
outcome  was  headache  response  defined  as  a  decrease   
in  pain  from  very  severe,  severe,  or  moderate  to  mild   
or none at 30 min. Secondary outcomes were pain-free   
rates, relief of associated symptoms, and AEs. The study   
recruited 118 patients who treated 154 cluster attacks.   
The responder rates at 30 min were 57% for sumatriptan   
and 26% for placebo (p = 0.002). Pain-free rates at 30   
min were 47% for sumatriptan and 18% for placebo (p =   
0.003). Sumatriptan was superior to placebo for most of   
the secondary outcomes. No serious AEs were recorded.   
Two patients reported chest tightness. The most frequently   
reported AE was a bitter taste with 21% with sumatriptan   
and 1% with placebo.  
  
2.3   Intranasal Zolmitriptan  
  
Intranasal zolmitriptan at doses of 5 and 10 mg was studied   
in two randomized placebo-controlled trials. One study of   
92 patients achieved a rate of pain relief from very severe,   
severe, or moderate to mild or no headache at 30 min of 62%   
at a dose of 10 mg and 40% at a dose of 5 mg. The com-  
parable result with placebo was 21%. The treatment effect   
was better in patients with episodic cluster headache than   
in patients with chronic cluster headache [11]. The second   
study evaluated 52 patients and the primary endpoint was   
headache relief at 30 min. This endpoint was met by 63% of   
patients treated with 10 mg, 50% with 5 mg, and 30% with   
placebo [12]. Tolerability was good and no serious AEs were   
reported.  
  
A meta-analysis of the two studies included 121 patients   
[13]. Headache relief at 30 min was observed in 63% of   
patients treated with 10 mg of zolmitriptan compared with   
48% treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan and 30% treated with   
placebo. This corresponds to an odds ratio of 8.68 and 3.48,   
respectively. The most common side effects of zolmitriptan   
were taste disturbances, nausea, chest tightness, and fatigue.  
In summary, zolmitriptan nasal spray at a preferred dose   
of 10 mg is effective in the treatment of cluster attacks. In   
  
2.4   Ergotamine Derivatives  
  
Because of the fast increase in plasma concentrations, dihy-  
droergotamine is best applied as an aerosol spray, a supposi-  
tory (no first-pass effect), or a subcutaneous injection [14-  
16]. One publication reported the use of two to three aerosol   
doses (0.35 mg each) with deep inhalation at the onset of   
an attack. The treatment did not significantly shorten the   
duration of the individual attack, neither did it reduce the   
frequency of attacks but it significantly reduced the inten-  
sity of the individual attack [14]. Ergotamine tartrate sup-  
positories are not able to abort attacks because of the slow   
onset of action, but may be used as short-term prophylaxis.   
While these studies suggest effectiveness, no prospective   
randomized controlled trial has confirmed this hypothesis.   
Dihydroergotamine spray is not available in many European   
countries.  
  
2.5   Others  
  
A randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel-group   
study investigated the efficacy and safety of the C213 (zol-  
mitriptan microneedle system) compared to placebo for the   
treatment of cluster attacks (NCT04066023). Results have   
not been made public.  
  
3   Oxygen Treatment  
  
Inhalation of oxygen is effective in up to 60% of patients.   
The recommended dosage is the inhalation of at least 12 L/  
min of 100% oxygen and has been tested in a randomized   
double-blind trial [17]. In some cases, up to 15 L/min is   
necessary, for a duration of 20 min using a non-rebreathe   
mask. Nasal canulae are generally not sufficient [18]. Differ-  
ent protocols and mask types are available [19]. A systematic   
review and meta-analysis published by the Cochrane Collab-  
oration in 2015 [20] included three trials on normobaric oxy-  
gen therapy compared to sham or ergotamine tartrate (145   
patients) into the quantitative analysis [17, 21, 22] and eight   
additional trials into the qualitative synthesis. The authors   
found a statistically significant effect for the termination of   
the attack and a 75% responder rate after 15 min. It needs   
to be noted that in the experience of the authors, in some   
patients, oxygen treatment may not end the attacks but seem   
to prolong them. In these cases, oxygen inhalation seems to

to (unnecessary) changes in the preventative medication. In   
these patients, oxygen therapy should be stopped.  
  
4   Bridging or Transitional Therapy  
  
Patients in whom cluster bouts start (bout = active period in   
episodic cluster headache) and patients with chronic cluster   
headache require preventive therapy. Because of possible   
side effects, doses of available drugs have to be increased   
slowly to prevent AEs. Therefore, treatment with immediate   
effect is needed to bridge the time until long-term preven-  
tive therapy becomes effective. Most bridging studies were   
performed with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can be used   
as oral or intravenous medication or injected into the greater   
occipital nerves. Corticosteroids should not be used long   
term because of their AE profile (Table 2).  
  
Jammes reported results from patients with cluster head-  
ache in a double-blind placebo-controlled study with a single   
crossover for prednisone [23]. A single oral dose of oral   
prednisone in 17 patients produced a short-term improve-  
ment. An open trial in Italy assessed high-dose methylpred-  
nisolone in 13 patients with episodic cluster headache [24].   
On day 8 of a new bout, methylprednisolone was given at an   
intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg body weight. The daily cluster   
attack frequency before administration of the corticosteroid   
was 1.38 ± 0.42 attacks and reduced to 0.83 ± 0.78 attacks   
7 days after treatment (p = 0.05). Three patients experienced   
complete remission from cluster attacks. Prednisone in peak   
doses of 10–80 mg/day was used in 19 patients with clus-  
ter headache in the USA [25]. Fourteen patients (73%) had   
greater than 50% relief from cluster attacks and 11 (58%) no   
longer had cluster attacks. Recurrence of cluster headache   
occurred in most patients when the prednisone dose was   
reduced to below 10–20 mg daily.  
  
The largest trial with 118 patients was a multicenter pla-  
cebo-controlled trial conducted in Germany [26]. Patients   
with episodic cluster headache within a new cluster bout   
lasting not longer than 30 days were randomized to 100 mg   
of oral prednisone for 5 days followed by tapering the dose   
  
or placebo. All patients received an increasing dose of oral   
verapamil for long-term prevention. One hundred and nine   
patients were available for analysis. Patients in the pred-  
nisone group had a mean of 7.1 attacks in the first week   
compared with 9.5 attacks in the placebo group. Seventy-one   
percent of patients in both groups reported AEs (most com-  
mon were nausea, dizziness, and headache, and additionally   
palpitations in the prednisone group).  
  
Corticosteroid injections in the area of the ipsilateral   
greater occipital nerve were investigated in a double-blind   
placebo-controlled trial in 16 patients with episodic head-  
ache and seven patients with chronic cluster headache [27].   
In patients with episodic cluster headache, the bout started   
less than 1 week prior to the treatment. Thirteen patients   
in the active arm received a suboccipital injection of both   
long-acting and short-acting betamethasone and ten patients   
received physiological saline as a placebo. Eleven patients   
(85%) in the corticosteroid group became attack free in the   
first week after the injection compared with no patient in the   
placebo group. The effect of corticosteroids lasted on aver-  
age 4 weeks. Remissions of cluster attacks lasted between   
4 and 26 months in five patients. Another study used the   
combination of 120 mg of methylprednisolone with lido-  
caine for injection into the area of the greater occipital nerve.   
This resulted in remissions of cluster attacks of 5–73 days   
[28]. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled   
trial enrolled patients with more than two cluster headache   
attacks per day [29]. Patients were randomly allocated to   
three suboccipital injections of cortivazol 3.75 mg within 3   
days or placebo. In all patients, preventive therapy with vera-  
pamil was initiated. The primary outcome was the reduction   
in the number of daily cluster attacks in the 72 h, 2–4 days   
after the third injection. The study included 43 patients, 15   
with chronic cluster headache and 28 with episodic cluster   
headache. Twenty of 21 patients who received cortivazol had   
a mean of two or fewer daily cluster attacks after injections   
compared with 12 of 22 patients treated with placebo (odds   
ratio 14.5, 95% CI 1.8–116.9; p = 0.012). Patients who were   
treated with cortivazol also had fewer cluster attacks in the   
first 15 days after injections than controls.  
  
In conclusion, corticosteroids are effective to bridge the   
time interval in new bouts of episodic cluster  headache

or chronic cluster headache until preventive drug therapy   
becomes effective (see below) [30]. Corticosteroids can be   
used in an oral form with dose tapering, as an intravenous   
injection, and also in the form of ipsilateral injections into   
the area of the greater occipital nerve. Some patients will   
experience a relapse of cluster attacks with decreasing doses   
of corticosteroids.  
  
5   Prevention of Cluster Headache  
  
Patients with episodic cluster headache, in whom the dura-  
tion of the bout is longer than 4–8 weeks, need preventive   
treatment. This is also particularly true for patients with   
chronic cluster headache. The most effective treatment with   
the best scientific evidence is verapamil, followed by lithium   
(Table 3).  
  
5.1   Verapamil  
  
Verapamil is the medication of choice as a preventive treat-  
ment in cluster headache [18]. The first randomized placebo-  
controlled trial with 30 patients investigated the efficacy of   
verapamil compared with placebo in the prophylaxis of epi-  
sodic cluster headache. Patients received either verapamil   
120 mg three times daily or a placebo for 2 weeks. Verapamil   
resulted in a significant reduction in cluster attack frequency   
and the need for abortive treatment [31]. Two open trials   
assessed the efficacy of verapamil. Seventy-two patients   
with episodic or chronic cluster headache were treated with   
  
verapamil starting with 200 mg [32]. Complete relief from   
cluster attacks was observed in 49 (94%) of 52 patients with   
episodic cluster headache, and 10 (55%) of 18 patients with   
chronic cluster headache. Most patients need 200–480 mg   
of verapamil. Twelve patients needed 520–960 mg. A sec-  
ond open study investigated verapamil in 84 patients with   
cluster headache [33]. Thirty-three (69%) patients improved   
more than 75% in terms of attack frequency. No differences   
with respect to efficacy were observed between episodic and   
chronic cluster headache. A pair-wise meta-analysis of the   
open-label studies indicated that 87% of patients reached   
either a complete response or a more than 50% reduction in   
attack frequency with verapamil [34].  
  
In clinical practice, treatment with verapamil is started   
with 40–80 mg three times daily. Some patients require   
doses up to 960 mg. Verapamil can lead to heart block [35].   
Therefore,  a  baseline  electrocardiogram  is  required  and   
should be repeated after dose increments of 160 mg. Treat-  
ment should last for the expected duration of a bout plus a   
few weeks after cluster attacks have finished. For discontinu-  
ation of verapamil, slow tapering is strictly recommended to   
avoid cardiac complications. Adverse events such as consti-  
pation and edema can be dose limiting. In rare cases, vera-  
pamil can lead to severe skin reactions [32, 36].  
  
5.2   Lithium  
  
Lithium is the second choice for the prevention of cluster   
headache. Lithium has more and potentially more danger-  
ous AEs than verapamil. With one exception, the efficacy

of lithium has only been investigated in open studies. Early   
studies involved small patient numbers [37-39]. On average,   
two-thirds of patients responded. A meta-analysis of three   
open trials [40-42] with 103 patients reported that 77% of   
patients reached either a complete response or a more than   
a 50% reduction in attack frequency with lithium [34]. A   
placebo-controlled study in episodic cluster headache was   
negative, possibly the observation period of 1 week was too   
short and the lithium concentrations were too low [43]. A   
prophylactic effect of lithium has been demonstrated in a   
retrospective case series for episodic cluster headache [40].   
In a comparative study of lithium and verapamil, the sub-  
stances did not differ in their efficacy, but verapamil was   
better tolerated [44]. The treatment with lithium requires   
monitoring of lithium plasma concentrations and kidney   
and thyroid function. These should be in a range of 0.4–0.8   
mEq/L. Concomitant use of diuretics and non-steroidal anti-  
inflammatory drugs should be avoided. Duration of treat-  
ment is similar to verapamil.  
  
5.3   Topiramate  
  
There  are  predominantly  case  reports  on  the  preventive   
therapy  of  cluster  headache  with  topiramate.  An  initial   
open-label study of ten patients reported a positive effect   
within 3 weeks [45]. Another open study of 36 consecutive   
patients including 26 with episodic cluster headache and ten   
with chronic cluster headache reported a reduction in cluster   
attacks of more than 50% in 7/33 patients. Doses of topira-  
mate ranged from 100 to 150 mg daily [46]. A third open   
study with 12 patients with cluster headache reported a good   
or moderate effect in 9/12 patients with cluster headache   
[47]. A prospective study from Spain with 26 patients, 12   
with episodic cluster headache and 14 with chronic cluster   
headache used a maximum dose of topiramate of 200 mg.   
This resulted in remission of the cluster period in 15 patients   
and reduced the number of attacks by >50% in six patients   
[48]. The mean time to remission was 2 weeks. In summary,   
there are only data on topiramate from open observational   
studies. Topiramate is a possible alternative in patients in   
whom verapamil or lithium is not effective or not tolerated.   
Clinical experience showed promising results if the medica-  
tion is well tolerated (most common side effect: cognitive   
disturbances, paresthesia, and weight loss). Topiramate is   
contra-indicated in nephrolithiasis and glaucoma. The rate of   
side effects can be reduced by slowly increasing the dosage   
by 25 mg/week. Topiramate can lead to mood swings and   
depression. This is relevant because of the increased risk of   
suicide in patients with cluster headache [49]  
  
5.4   Sodium Valproate  
  
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on   
the effect of sodium valproate in cluster headache included   
96 patients (17 chronic cluster headache), 50 in the sodium   
valproate group and 46 in the placebo group. Treatment was   
given for 2 weeks with a dose of 1000–2000 mg of sodium   
valproate per day. The primary study endpoint was at least   
a 50% reduction in the mean number of cluster attacks per   
week. For this endpoint, there was no statistical difference   
between sodium valproate and placebo [50]. However, the   
authors point out that this could also be due to the rela-  
tively high rate of patients in whom cluster attacks resolved   
spontaneously. An open-label study in patients with cluster   
headache reported that 73% of patients with cluster headache   
experienced a reduction in pain [51]. Another open study   
in 15 patients with cluster headache showed treatment suc-  
cess in 11/15 patients [52]. Cluster attacks subsided in nine   
patients. The dose of sodium valproate ranged from 600 to   
2000 mg/day. In summary, there is no scientific evidence   
that sodium valproate is effective in cluster headache and the   
treatment of women of childbearing age is contraindicated.  
  
5.5   Gabapentin  
  
The first report on the use of gabapentin in a patient with   
refractory chronic cluster headache was published in 2000   
[53]. The patient became symptom free with a daily dose of   
1800 mg of gabapentin after previous therapies with lithium,   
verapamil, and pizotifen were unsuccessful. In a small Ital-  
ian study in eight patients with episodic cluster headache   
and four patients with chronic cluster headache, all of whom   
were refractory to traditional prophylactics, a dose of 1000   
mg of gabapentin resulted in a significant reduction in the   
length of the cluster period [54]. Another open-label study   
examined eight patients with refractory chronic cluster head-  
ache, six of whom responded [55]. Another small study of   
14 patients treated for 3.5 months with gabapentin resulted   
in a mean 45% reduction in cluster attacks [56]. In summary,   
there is evidence only from open-label small observational   
series that some patients with refractory chronic cluster   
headache may respond to gabapentin.  
  
5.6   Melatonin  
  
Because of the circadian rhythm of cluster attacks, the use   
of melatonin for the prevention of cluster headache has also   
been investigated. A small randomized trial of 20 patients   
with cluster headache (two with chronic cluster headache)   
studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled design of 10   
  
mg of melatonin or placebo at night-time for 14 days [57].   
Melatonin resulted in a significant reduction in the number   
of cluster attacks. Five out of ten patients were classified as   
responders. Other small case series also reported an effect   
of melatonin in chronic cluster headache [58] and in nine   
patients as adjunctive treatment [59]. Melatonin has very   
good tolerability and can be used in patients who do not   
tolerate lithium or verapamil.  
  
5.7   Monoclonal Antibodies Against Calcitonin   
  
Gene‑Related Peptide  
  
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important   
role in the pathophysiology of migraine where both mono-  
clonal antibodies against CGRP or the CGRP receptor are   
approved  for  migraine  prophylaxis  and  CGRP  receptor   
antagonists are investigated for short-term therapy of the   
acute migraine attack and for migraine prophylaxis. Serum   
levels of CGRP are also elevated in cluster headache during   
cluster periods [60]. Patients with active cluster headache   
have increased CGRP levels in tear fluid compared with   
healthy subjects, which are reduced to control levels after   
intake of attack abortive medication [61]. Galcanezumab has   
been investigated for the prophylaxis of both episodic and   
chronic cluster headache. In the episodic cluster headache   
trial, 106 patients were randomized to galcanezumab or pla-  
cebo. In the first 3 weeks of therapy, the frequency of cluster   
attacks decreased by 52% in the galcanezumab group and   
27% in the placebo group [62]. The chronic cluster headache   
trial included 237 patients [63]. The investigators observed   
a mean weekly reduction in cluster attacks of 5.4 with gal-  
canezumab compared with 4.6 with placebo. This difference   
was not statistically significant. Galcanezumab is approved   
in the USA for the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache.  
Teva Pharmaceutical announced in 2019 the termination   
of the ENFORCE Phase III development program of fre-  
manezumab for the treatment of cluster headache (https://   
www. clini caltr ialsa rena. com/ news/ teva- frema nezum ab- clust   
er- heada che). A futility analysis of the clinical trial for epi-  
sodic cluster headache showed that the primary endpoint   
of a mean change in the weekly average number of cluster   
headache attacks from baseline during the 4-week treatment   
duration would not be met. The study program also included   
a chronic cluster headache trial that was also discontinued.   
Another CGRP monoclonal antibody study involving fre-  
manezumab was recently discontinued because of a lack of   
efficacy.  
  
In  an  ongoing  study  with  intravenous  eptinezumab,   
eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive   
treatment, in a blinded manner, of two infusions of either   
eptinezumab or placebo in a cross-over manner after 12   
weeks during a placebo-controlled period and an active   
treatment period of the study. The total duration of the study   
  
39  
  
is 24 weeks, including a safety follow-up period of 8 weeks   
(NCT04688775).  
  
In conclusion, only preventive therapy with verapamil   
and lithium has evidence from randomized studies. The   
other drugs mentioned here can be used on a trial-and-error   
basis based on co-morbidities and anticipated AEs. The   
authors clinical experience is that the combination of vera-  
pamil with lithium or with topiramate is helpful if verapamil   
alone is ineffective.  
  
6   Future Therapy of Cluster Headache  
  
6.1   Ketamine  
  
Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.   
In a study in 2016, 13 patients with chronic headache and   
16 with episodic cluster headache were treated with low   
doses of intravenous ketamine at 2-week intervals [64]. In   
patients with episodic cluster headache, this resulted in a   
suspension of cluster attacks for a period of between 3 and   
18 months. Half of the patients with chronic cluster head-  
ache also responded to ketamine. However, the study was   
not placebo controlled. A ketamine-magnesium combina-  
tion was studied in an open trial in patients with chronic   
cluster headache who were resistant to at least three pre-  
ventive treatments [65]. Seventeen patients received a sin-  
gle ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 2 h) combined with   
magnesium sulfate (3000 mg). The number of daily cluster   
attacks decreased from 4.3 ± 2.4 before treatment to 1.3 ±   
1.0 after treatment resulting in a difference of − 3.1 (95%   
CI − 4.5 to − 1.6), p < 0.001). Thirteen of 17 patients   
were responders. Mild sedation was reported by 41.2% of   
patients. These results indicate a possible role of ketamine.   
This needs to be validated by a placebo-controlled trial.   
As a caveat, ketamine also has a strong potential for addic-  
tion. An ongoing trial in Denmark is a proof-of-concept   
study for the evaluation of the effect of a ketamine intra-  
nasal spray in the treatment of chronic cluster headache   
(EudraCT2019-001260-29).  
  
6.2   Pasireotide (SOM230)  
  
Somatostatin plays an important role in the pathophysiology   
of pain. Somatostatin has a very short half-life and is there-  
fore not suitable for the treatment of cluster attacks. Pasire-  
otide has a much longer half-life than somatostatin. Patients   
with episodic and chronic cluster headache were enrolled   
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II   
trial. After the inclusion of 28 patients, the study was dis-  
continued because of a lack of efficacy (NCT02619617).  
  
Drug Treatment of Cluster Headache40   
  
6.3   OnabotulinumtoxinA  
  
OnabotulinumtoxinA was investigated in an open trial in   
patients with chronic cluster headache [66]. Seventeen male   
patients completed the study of 28 weeks. A > 50% reduc-  
tion in cumulative headache minutes was observed in 59%   
of the participants. A second open-label trial in ten sub-  
jects with injections of onabotulinumtoxinA toward the otic   
ganglion did not find a statistically significant reduction in   
the number of attacks per week at month 2 after injection   
compared to the baseline [67]. Another trial with injections   
of onabotulinumtoxinA into the sphenopalatine ganglion is   
ongoing (NCT03944876).  
  
6.4   Other Treatments  
  
Other treatments under investigation are lysergic acid dieth-  
ylamide and psilocybin. The Clusterbusters.org medication   
use survey aimed to investigate the effects of both conven-  
tional and alternative medications used in cluster headache   
[68]. The analysis included responses from 496 participants.   
The indoleamine hallucinogens, psilocybin, lysergic acid   
diethylamide, and lysergic acid amide, were comparable   
to or more efficacious than most conventional medications.   
These agents shortened or aborted a cluster period and were   
effective in some patients with chronic cluster headache.   
Sodium oxybate was reported in case reports of patients with   
cluster headache and sleep disturbances [69, 70].  
  
7   Conclusions  
  
Cluster headache is extremely distressing owing to the   
high intensity of pain attacks and significantly affects the   
quality of life of affected patients [71]. For attack therapy,   
only oxygen, subcutaneous sumatriptan, and intranasal   
sumatriptan and zolmitriptan are available and approved.   
Both oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan remain very   
expensive and are not reimbursed in many healthcare sys-  
tems. For example, in a real-life study in Denmark, of 399   
patients with cluster headache, only 30 treated their attacks   
with subcutaneous sumatriptan. A 100% treatment effect   
was achieved by 20% and a 50% pain relief by a further   
10% [72]. There is a considerable need to develop new   
fast-acting therapies for the treatment of cluster attacks.  
  
Even more problematic is the prophylactic therapy of   
cluster headache. Here, there are very few placebo-con-  
trolled studies. The best studied substances, verapamil   
and lithium, have significant adverse drug reactions and   
many patients discontinue therapy within 6–12 months.   
  
H. C. Diener, A. May   
  
In the Danish cohort study, only 20% of patients reported   
being responders to prophylaxis with verapamil [72]. For   
the other investigated substances, there are only data from   
open studies. Therefore, these substances are not approved   
for the prophylaxis of cluster headache. Here, we would   
need evidence for efficacy from randomized placebo-con-  
trolled trials. However, there are considerable difficulties   
in designing and conducting these trials: for example, in   
episodic cluster headache, it is always very difficult to   
identify whether an improvement in the headache occurs   
because the cluster period ends spontaneously or whether   
it is a treatment effect. Moreover, surprisingly, there is a   
relatively high placebo effect, which makes it very difficult   
to prove the efficacy of a new therapy. Again, it would be   
desirable if there were effective and well-tolerated new   
therapies for the prophylaxis of cluster headache.
