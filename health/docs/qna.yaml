  - context: |
      Cluster headache is extremely distressing owing to the
      high intensity of pain attacks and significantly affects the
      quality of life of affected patients [71]. For attack therapy,
      only oxygen, subcutaneous sumatriptan, and intranasal
      sumatriptan and zolmitriptan are available and approved.
      Both oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan remain very
      expensive and are not reimbursed in many healthcare sys-
      tems. For example, in a real-life study in Denmark, of 399
      patients with cluster headache, only 30 treated their attacks
      with subcutaneous sumatriptan. A 100% treatment effec
      was achieved by 20% and a 50% pain relief by a further
      10% [72]. There is a considerable need to develop new
      fast-acting therapies for the treatment of cluster attacks.

      Even more problematic is the prophylactic therapy of
      cluster headache. Here, there are very few placebo-con-
      trolled studies. The best studied substances, verapamil
      and lithium, have significant adverse drug reactions and
      many patients discontinue therapy within 6–12 months.

      In the Danish cohort study, only 20% of patients reported
      being responders to prophylaxis with verapamil [72]. For
      the other investigated substances, there are only data from
      open studies. Therefore, these substances are not approved
      for the prophylaxis of cluster headache. Here, we would
      need evidence for efficacy from randomized placebo-con-
      trolled trials. However, there are considerable difficulties
      in designing and conducting these trials; for example, in
      episodic cluster headache, it is always very difficult to
      identify whether an improvement in the headache occurs
      because the cluster period ends spontaneously or whether
      it is a treatment effect. Moreover, surprisingly, there is a
      relatively high placebo effect, which makes it very difficul
      to prove the efficacy of a new therapy. Again, it would be
      desirable if there were effective and well-tolerated new
      therapies for the prophylaxis of cluster headache.

      - question: |
          What is the percentage of patients that treated their attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan?
        answer: |
          In a real-life study in Denmark, of 399
          patients with cluster headache, only 30 treated their attacks
          with subcutaneous sumatriptan.
  - context: |
      Verapamil is the medication of choice as a preventive treat-
      ment in cluster headache [18]. The first randomized placebo-
      controlled trial with 30 patients investigated the efficacy of
      verapamil compared with placebo in the prophylaxis of epi-
      sodic cluster headache. Patients received either verapamil
      120 mg three times daily or a placebo for 2 weeks. Verapamil
      resulted in a significant reduction in cluster attack frequency
      and the need for abortive treatment [31]. Two open trials
      assessed the efficacy of verapamil. Seventy-two patients
      with episodic or chronic cluster headache were treated with

      verapamil starting with 200 mg [32]. Complete relief from
      cluster attacks was observed in 49 (94%) of 52 patients with
      episodic cluster headache, and 10 (55%) of 18 patients with
      chronic cluster headache. Most patients need 200–480 mg
      of verapamil. Twelve patients needed 520–960 mg. A sec-
      ond open study investigated verapamil in 84 patients with
      cluster headache [33]. Thirty-three (69%) patients improved
      more than 75% in terms of attack frequency. No differences
      with respect to efficacy were observed between episodic and
      chronic cluster headache. A pair-wise meta-analysis of the
      open-label studies indicated that 87% of patients reached
      either a complete response or a more than 50% reduction in
      attack frequency with verapamil [34].

      In clinical practice, treatment with verapamil is started
      with 40–80 mg three times daily. Some patients require
      doses up to 960 mg. Verapamil can lead to heart block [35].
      Therefore, a baseline electrocardiogram is required and
      should be repeated after dose increments of 160 mg. Treat-
      ment should last for the expected duration of a bout plus a
      few weeks after cluster attacks have finished. For discontinu-
      ation of verapamil, slow tapering is strictly recommended to
      avoid cardiac complications. Adverse events such as consti-
      pation and edema can be dose limiting. In rare cases, vera-
      pamil can lead to severe skin reactions [32, 36].

  - context: |
      indirect comparisons, the efficacy is inferior to that of the
      subcutaneous application of sumatriptan. Patients with epi-
      sodic cluster headache respond usually better than patients
      with chronic cluster headache. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is
      only available in a 5-mg dose.
      Sumatriptan  nasal  spray  was  investigated  in  a  dose  of
      20 mg in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial [10]. The study included patients with episodic and
      chronic cluster headache. Patients treated one attack with
      a sumatriptan 20-mg nasal spray and another attack with
      placebo. Headache intensity was measured on a five-poin
      scale at time intervals between 5 and 30 min. The primary
      outcome  was  headache  response  defined  as  a  decrease
      in  pain  from  very  severe,  severe,  or  moderate  to  mild
      or none at 30 min. Secondary outcomes were pain-free
      rates, relief of associated symptoms, and AEs. The study
      recruited 118 patients who treated 154 cluster attacks.
      The responder rates at 30 min were 57% for sumatriptan
      and 26% for placebo (p = 0.002). Pain-free rates at 30
      min were 47% for sumatriptan and 18% for placebo (p =
      0.003). Sumatriptan was superior to placebo for most of
      the secondary outcomes. No serious AEs were recorded.
      Two patients reported chest tightness. The most frequently
      reported AE was a bitter taste with 21% with sumatriptan
      and 1% with placebo.
      The bitter taste was not associated with any other AEs.

      By far the most effective therapy for acute cluster attacks is
      the subcutaneous injection of 6 mg of sumatriptan. In the
      first randomized placebo-controlled trial with 39 patients,
      two cluster attacks were treated in random order with 6
      mg  of  sumatriptan  subcutaneously  or  placebo.  The  pri-
      mary endpoint was freedom from pain or almost complete
      relief from headache within 10 or 15 min [5]. This endpoin
      [15 min] was achieved in 74% of the patients treated with
      sumatriptan and 26% for placebo. The success rate of 6 mg
      of sumatriptan subcutaneously for pain free at 10 min was
      36% and for placebo 3% [5]. The second study investigated
      6 and 12 mg of sumatriptan subcutaneously compared to
      placebo. Headache improvement to mild or no pain at 15
      min was 35% for placebo, 75% for 6 mg of sumatriptan, and
      80% for 12 mg of sumatriptan [6]. The pooled analysis of
      the Cochrane Collaboration reported pain-free results after
      15 min for 48% with sumatriptan and 17% with placebo,
      resulting in a number needed to treat of 3.3 (95% confidence
      interval [CI] 2.4–5.0). The rates for headache relief after 15
      min were 32% and 7%, resulting in a number needed to trea
      of 2.4 (95% CI 1.9–3.2) [7].

      Meanwhile, a 3-mg dose of sumatriptan subcutaneously
      is also available in some countries and sufficient for some
      patients [8]. Sumatriptan is well tolerated. Rare adverse
      events (AEs) include local injection-site reactions, nausea,
      drowsiness,  fatigue,  and  paresthesia.  Contraindications,
      according to the label, include severe cardiovascular dis-
      eases such as coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke and
      transient ischemic attack, or multiple vascular risk factors.
      Although many patients with cluster headache have vascu-
      lar risk factors [9], there have been no reports of stroke or
      myocardial infarction in patients with cluster headache treat-
      ing their attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan. It must be
      considered that some patients with chronic cluster headache
      inject sumatriptan three times daily or more for years.

  - context: |
      Cluster headache is characterized by strictly unilateral
      attacks of severe head and facial pain. Cluster headache is
      a primary headache, i.e., the headache is a syndrome in its
      own right and not just a symptom of another disease. The
      attacks reach their maximum within a short time and may
      also have a rapid offset. The pain is extremely severe. The
      localization is strictly unilateral with a particular locali-
      zation orbital, retro-orbital, and frontotemporal. Cranial
      autonomic symptoms ipsilateral to the pain occur during
      the attack. These include conjunctival injection and/or
      lacrimation, nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid
      edema, forehead and facial sweating, forehead and facial
      skin redness, ptosis, and or miosis. Attacks are accom-
      panied by physical agitation or restlessness. Attacks las
      between 15 min and 3 h and can be triggered by the intake
      of alcohol if the patient is in the active period. Attack frequency ranges from one attack every 2 days to eight attacks
      per day. For episodic cluster headache, bouts frequently
      start with one to two attacks per week, may progress to
      several/day over 1–2 weeks, and then taper over 1–2 weeks
      after occurring at the high plateau for up to several or more
