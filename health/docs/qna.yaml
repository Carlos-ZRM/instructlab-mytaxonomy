      By far the most effective therapy for acute cluster attacks is   
      the subcutaneous injection of 6 mg of sumatriptan. In the   
      first randomized placebo-controlled trial with 39 patients,   
      two cluster attacks were treated in random order with 6   
      mg  of  sumatriptan  subcutaneously  or  placebo.  The  pri-  
      mary endpoint was freedom from pain or almost complete   
      relief from headache within 10 or 15 min [5]. This endpoint   
      [15 min] was achieved in 74% of the patients treated with   
      sumatriptan and 26% for placebo. The success rate of 6 mg   
      of sumatriptan subcutaneously for pain free at 10 min was   
      36% and for placebo 3% [5]. The second study investigated   
      6 and 12 mg of sumatriptan subcutaneously compared to   
      placebo. Headache improvement to mild or no pain at 15   
      min was 35% for placebo, 75% for 6 mg of sumatriptan, and   
      80% for 12 mg of sumatriptan [6]. The pooled analysis of   
      the Cochrane Collaboration reported pain-free results after   
      15 min for 48% with sumatriptan and 17% with placebo,   
      resulting in a number needed to treat of 3.3 (95% confidence   
      interval [CI] 2.4–5.0). The rates for headache relief after 15   
      min were 32% and 7%, resulting in a number needed to treat   
      of 2.4 (95% CI 1.9–3.2) [7].  
        
      Meanwhile, a 3-mg dose of sumatriptan subcutaneously   
      is also available in some countries and sufficient for some   
      patients [8]. Sumatriptan is well tolerated. Rare adverse   
      events (AEs) include local injection-site reactions, nausea,   
      drowsiness,  fatigue,  and  paresthesia.  Contraindications,   
      according to the label, include severe cardiovascular dis-  
      eases such as coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke and   
      transient ischemic attack, or multiple vascular risk factors.   
      Although many patients with cluster headache have vascu-  
      lar risk factors [9], there have been no reports of stroke or
      myocardial infarction in patients with cluster headache treat-  
      ing their attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan. It must be   
      considered that some patients with chronic cluster headache   
      inject sumatriptan three times daily or more for years.

  - context: |
      Cluster headache is characterized by strictly unilateral   
      attacks of severe head and facial pain. Cluster headache is   
      a primary headache, i.e., the headache is a syndrome in its   
      own right and not just a symptom of another disease. The   
      attacks reach their maximum within a short time and may   
      also have a rapid offset. The pain is extremely severe. The   
      localization is strictly unilateral with a particular locali-  
      zation orbital, retro-orbital, and frontotemporal. Cranial   
      autonomic symptoms ipsilateral to the pain occur during   
      the attack. These include conjunctival injection and/or   
      lacrimation, nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid   
      edema, forehead and facial sweating, forehead and facial   
      skin redness, ptosis, and or miosis. Attacks are accom-  
      panied by physical agitation or restlessness. Attacks last   
      between 15 min and 3 h and can be triggered by the intake   
      of alcohol if the patient is in the active period. Attack frequency ranges from one attack every 2 days to eight attacks   
      per day. For episodic cluster headache, bouts frequently   
      start with one to two attacks per week, may progress to   
      several/day over 1–2 weeks, and then taper over 1–2 weeks   
      after occurring at the high plateau for up to several or more
